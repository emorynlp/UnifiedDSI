# missing related work for other induction tasks
- has text generation for induction/clustering been tried before?
* need a literature review broadened to more than just TOD induction

# manual tuning of window parameters
- manual tuning hurts generalizability
- undercuts advantage over traditional clustering
- why didn't we allow the model to explicitly decide to remove slots?
* address with denoising approach, which does not involve rule-based methods or tuning

# training dataset size
- dataset is small, looks bad at face value
- what if the model performs better if trained on more data?
* more DOTS data is being generated

# evaluation metric validity
- what is the empirical evidence for one metric outperforming another?
- examples of bad matches can be found with any automatic evaluation metric of SSI
* need a human judgement study with IAA and Human-Metric agreement calculated

# evaluation variance due to shuffling
- streaming approaches can be sensitive to the order data is input
* run experiments multiple times and average results

# evaluation dataset size
- 25 dialogues / 5 scenarios is insufficient to cover important evaluation cases
- more domains needed
* generate and correct more data

# evaluation dataset artificiality
- dataset was generated by GPT, so it does not represent real-world application
* evaluate naturalness and maybe difficulty (coreferences, implications, etc) of data by human judgement
* test if slot schema of eval dataset scenarios can be correctly generated from scratch
* recommend evaluation of small models on all datasets, which fail to memorize benchmark schemas
* human paraphrasing of all turns in the evaluation data??

# eval data generated using training data pipeline
- dataset was generated from the same distribution as the training data, so DOTS model scores are possibly inflated
* handcrafted purposefully out-of-distribution dialogue scenarios
* maybe also handcraft the slot schema?
* human paraphrasing of all turns in the evaluation data??
  * automatic paraphrasing? with additional style control?
