I have a candidate for you: David Kim, with 2 years of experience, a Nursing Degree, available on a contract basis, skilled in Geriatrics and Patient Care, speaks English, and does not require certification. How does that sound?
That sounds like a great match! Can we check his references?

How about Henry Davis? He has 8 years of experience, a Nursing qualification, available on a contract basis, skilled in Communication and Critical Thinking, speaks English and German, requires certification, and has references. Would you like to consider him?
He doesn't meet the skills requirement or the certification preference, so let's keep searching.

She doesn't fit the availability requirement, so let's keep looking for a contract option.

Hey, can you help me find a Query Filter for discounted products?
  [37mfilter_name=None, type=price, source=None, region=None, demographic=None, time_range=None, priority=None, active=None[0m
Sure! Are you looking for discounts in a specific region or demographic?
Yes, I'm focusing on North America and targeting adults.
  [37mfilter_name=None, type=price, source=None, region=North America, demographic=adults, time_range=None, priority=None, active=None[0m
Great! I found two options for discounted products in North America targeting adults. Would you like to see both?
Yes, please show me both options!
  [37mfilter_name=None, type=price, source=None, region=North America, demographic=adults, time_range=None, priority=None, active=None[0m
The first option is "Discounted Products" from sales_data, active with a priority of 1. The second option is also "Discounted Products" from web_traffic, active with a priority of 1 as well. Which one do you prefer?
I prefer the one from web_traffic.
  [37mfilter_name=Discounted Products, type=None, source=web_traffic, region=North America, demographic=adults, time_range=None, priority=1, active=True[0m
Got it! So, you choose the "Discounted Products" from web_traffic. Is there anything else you need?

  [37msorting_name=None, type=None, method=None, time_complexity=None, space_complexity=None, data_type_supported=None, parallelizable=None[0m
Sure! What type of data are you looking to sort, like integers, floats, or strings?
I'm looking to sort floats.
  [37msorting_name=None, type=None, method=None, time_complexity=None, space_complexity=None, data_type_supported=floats, parallelizable=None[0m
For sorting floats, I recommend "Merge Sort" or "Bucket Sort." Do you have a preference for time complexity or space complexity?

  [37msorting_name=None, type=merge, method=None, time_complexity=None, space_complexity=O(1), data_type_supported=floats, parallelizable=None[0m
In that case, "Bucket Sort" has a space complexity of O(n), while "Merge Sort" has O(n) as well. Unfortunately, none meet the O(1) requirement for floats. Would you like to reconsider?
Yes, let's consider changing the space complexity requirement to O(n).
  [37msorting_name=None, type=merge, method=None, time_complexity=O(n log n), space_complexity=O(n), data_type_supported=floats, parallelizable=None[0m
